# Phylogenetic Inference with Julia

Converts distance matrices into phylogenetic trees via neighbour joining and UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean).

The Julia file contains all the relevant code; the Jupyter Notebook presents it a bit more neatly for human eyes and contains the original project instructions.

A term project for the course "Programming in Julia for Diversity Linguistics" (Prof. Gerhard Jäger, University of Tübingen, summer 2020) by Jekaterina Kaparina and Verena Blaschke (equal contribution).
